Hi guys, thank you for checking out my little project! 😊

I want to explain what **modulo** means, so you can understand this line of code:
```js
index = (index + 1) % quotes.length;

> Modulo in real life is like this:
Let’s say you have a certain amount of money, and you want to buy something that costs a fixed price.
You check how many times you can buy it.
If your money is not enough to buy even one, then you keep all your money.
That amount you’re left with — that’s the modulo.



> 🔁 It’s the remainder you have after buying as many items as possible.

🧠 Example:

If you have 17$, and one croissant costs 4 $:
You can buy 4 croissants (4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16), and you’ll be left with 1$.

So:

17 % 4 = 1 ✅
